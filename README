This repository contains one of two datasets used in the following study:

Turesky TK, Escalante, E, Loh M, Gaab N. Longitudinal trajectories of brain development from infancy to school age and their relationship to literacy development, https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.29.601366.

For the other dataset, please see https://osf.io/axz5r/.

All participants included in this repository had MR images from at least two timepoints that passed the QC standards for the manuscript referenced above. Any MR images for these participants from additional timepoints were also included regardless of whether they passed the QC standards.

Please note that session numbers correspond to the following developmental timepoints:  
ses-01 = infant  
ses-02 = toddler  
ses-03 = pre-reading  
ses-04 = beginning reading  
ses-05 = emergent reading  

FreeSurfer's mri_deface was used to deface all T1w images, except for the following partipants, for whom we used mideface:

Images where mri_deface did not sufficiently distort the face:  
sub-04/ses-03  
sub-29/ses-04  
sub-34/ses-02  
sub-52/ses-04  
sub-55/ses-01  
sub-65/ses-04  
sub-70/ses-05  
sub-72/ses-03  

Images where mri_deface cut into brain tissue:  
sub-12/ses-03  
sub-12/ses-04  
sub-15/ses-05  
sub-57/ses-05  
sub-62/ses-05  
sub-79/ses-04
